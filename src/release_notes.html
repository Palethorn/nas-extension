        </ul>

        <h3>Regarding migration to Manifest V3</h3>
        Chrome forces extensions to migrate to a new manifest version. I wanted to do this for a long time but I always 
        stumble on some kind of problem. In short, new extensions must use declarativeNetRequest for handling blocking 
        HTTP requests. This extension uses regexFilter now, with a redirect action. Old extension was used simple string 
        processing to determine whether it should redirect a user to a player or not. This was very reliable since the 
        URL could be split and analyzed to make a choice. The new extension is relying in a regex pattern to detect a 
        streaming URL, and this is very finicky in my opinion because nothing short of a very greedy regex would work 
        reliable enough. That means it captures the manifest.mpd, for example, if you type it in on some search engine 
        and then it improperly redirects. In time I may devise a better pattern but for now if this happens just click 
        on the Disable DNR on the extension menu. Like shown on the image below:

        <div style="margin: 20px">
            <img src="assets/disable_dnr.png" />
        </div>

        Alternatively, you can head on to the options and try to edit the DNR rules yourself. Disabling DNR only 
        disables redirection using left click. I've added context menus for links and selections which you can use 
        instead.

        <div style="margin: 20px">
            <img src="assets/context_menu.png" />
        </div>

        It's also been interesting to comply with the firefox side of things, with the adding of dynamic rules and 
        regarding their permissions and security. In my tests firefox just blocks the request for now and requires 
        additional manual navigation to redirect the URL. It also required me to manually enable all permissions on 
        extension options, which I hope won't be necessary when I publish the extension, but I will test it some more.
